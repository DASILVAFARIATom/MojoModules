## Tremøjø :
Tremøjø is an advanced **tremolo unit** :

Its modulation rate changes depending on the input signal shape/volume :  
  - Acceleration mode : -> "**Accelerator**" : rate increases when input signal is louder
  - Acceleration mode : -> "**Decelerator**" : rate decreases when input signal is louder
  - Acceleration mode : -> "**Constant**" : No acceleration 
  
The "**Stereo**" button enables or disables stereo. The "**Release**" slider sets the amount of time needed for the modulation to decrease/increase its rate after an acceleration/deceleration. Finally, the "**Sensitivity**" button manages the loudness of input signal required to trigger the accelerator. 

### Installation : 
$\Rightarrow$ Download the windows installer and launch it. Install the .vst3 file inside your usual VST3 path (it might be *C:\Programs\Common Files\VST3* or *C:\Programs (x86)\Common Files\VST3*).
